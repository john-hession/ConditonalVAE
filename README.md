##README

This project implements and analyzes Conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs) on FashionMNIST and COCO. 
Our implementations explore the capabilities of conditional VAEs at several scales in both structured, simple domains and complex, real-world images.
We also test the effectiveness of different neural net arcitectures (Fully Connected versus Convolutional layers) and 
of different conditioning methods (Adding conditional versus concatenating inputs in bottleneck).

This work was completed by Ryan D'cunha, Ashley Hong, Julian Kneuppel, and John Hession as part of a final project for Duke's ECE685 class, taught by Vahid Tarokh.
Further information about the work can be found in EECE_685_Final_Report.pdf.
